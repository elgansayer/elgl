## 2026-08-05 - [Add Helmet and secure CORS]
**Vulnerability:** Missing secure HTTP headers and overly permissive CORS policy.
**Learning:** Default NestJS/Express apps need external middleware to set security headers. The CORS config was defaulting to '*'.
**Prevention:** Always use `helmet` and configure CORS with specific origins from environment variables.

## 2026-08-11 - [Replace Insecure Math.random() with randomUUID()]
**Vulnerability:** Weak random number generation (`Math.random()`) used for security purposes (rate-limit bypass keys).
**Learning:** `Math.random()` generates predictable values. Using it to generate keys or identifiers for security contexts like rate-limiting makes the application susceptible to bypass or collision attacks.
**Prevention:** Always use Node.js's native `crypto.randomUUID()` or `crypto.randomBytes()` for generating unique identifiers, tokens, or security keys.
