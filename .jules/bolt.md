## Performance Optimizations

- **Date:** 2026-08-06
- **Context:** Resolving N+1 query in `EventsService.checkReminders` (backend)
- **Bottleneck:** Iterating over events and calling `.eq()` for each event RSVP fetch leads to significant database roundtrips (N queries for N events).
- **Optimization Strategy:** Extract all `event_ids` into an array and perform a single batch lookup using the Supabase `.in('event_id', eventIds)` operator. Afterwards, map the results back to the original objects in-memory using a `Map`.
- **Edge Case Addressed:** Before executing `.in()`, always ensure the provided array is not empty (`if (typedEvents.length === 0) return;`) to avoid Supabase API errors with invalid queries.
- **Measured Impact:** Simulated execution time for 1,000 events dropped from ~10,325ms down to ~43ms.
